# Bioinfo Essentials @ I2BC

Everything you need to know while working as a bioinformatician at I2BC: documentations, short videos, Twitter threads, etc.  
Maybe you don't master them all, but you should know they exist!  

## TOOLS EVERY BIOINFORMATICIAN SHOULD KNOW

### Using the I2BC cluster
  https://intranet.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/intranet/sics/Main/Cluster (Intranet, needs multipass)

  Connecting to the I2BC cluster from home (with a non I2BC station)  
    ssh firstname.lastname@passerelle.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr  
    enter passwd then :  
    ssh firstname.lastname@i2bc-cluster.calcul.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr  
    youâ€™re on the cluster
